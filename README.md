# Ann Arbor R User Group - Beginner Workshop

This repository contains all the code for the slides we use during our Beginner's Workshop.

The slides are generated with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) and can be viewed at <https://annarborrusergroup.github.io/BeginnerWorkshop/>.


## Structure

The workshop is split into distinct lessons which can be found in the `lessons/` directory as RMarkdown files (`*.Rmd`).

The lessons are included in the order specified in `_bookdown.yml` and is preceded by content in `index.Rmd` which is listed first in the resulting book.
